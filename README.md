# ChatClient
Duarte and Manuel's first joint project

This project is a Chat Client.
It's a web app that generates live chat rooms created by the users by simply writing the name of the desired room. The app
will generate a URL of the kind <domain>/<name_of_the_room>, so that if another user wants to join in he just has to put
this on the URL.
After joining the room, you have to choose the username and then you can talk using an input box and see the conversation
in an output box. An example:
USERNAME: John
INPUT: "Hello, anyone?"
OUTPUT: 15:21:34 * John says Hello, anyone?
